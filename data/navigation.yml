### Jekyll/Minimal Mistakes Implementation Notes

- Each section can be a separate Markdown file in `_pages` or `_includes` and referenced in your layout.
- Projects and Experience can use data files (`_data/`) or collections for easier management.
- Contact form will need an external service for submissions.
- Update navigation in `_data/navigation.yml` to reflect new sections.

---

## Next Steps

1. Draft content for each section following the above structure.
2. Decide on any extra features (like filters, images, etc.).
3. Update your Jekyll configuration and navigation to include these sections.
4. (If needed) Choose and set up a contact form service.

Let me know if you want templates or markdown examples for any of the sections!
